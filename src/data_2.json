We firmly believe that everyone, regardless of background, can thrive as a computer scientist. We start off each summer assuming absolutely no prior programming experience, and by the time we're done our students are routinely creating their own games and custom animations as final projects. Our students have gone on to study computer science in college (around 40% of students go on to take a CS class in their first year of college, and around 20% end up declaring computer science as a major).

Over five days, high school and college students build confidence and cultivate core leadership skills such as teamwork, public speaking, and diversity/cultural understanding. These are skills that can later be applied on school campuses as young adults and throughout life. Throughout the week, American Red Cross youth volunteers and staff members create sessions and activities that reinforce delegates’ individual and team leadership skills. Over 100 youth come back from camp each year as stronger individuals. Delegates form friendships that last a lifetime. Moreover, they become leaders who make a difference in their schools and communities.",

The 1946 American Legion National Convention adopted the event as an official youth activity. Three years later, it became American Legion Boys Nation. At the event, each delegate acts as a senator from his Boys State. The young lawmakers caucus at the beginning of the session, then organize into committees and conduct hearings on bills submitted by program delegates. Senators learn the proper method of handling bills, according to U.S. Senate rules. Participation in the political process is emphasized throughout the week, including organization of party conventions and nominating and electing a president and vice president.",

   "description": "U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) is a congressionally mandated program that focuses on the youth-oriented mission “Motivating Young People to be Better Citizens”. It is one of the largest youth programs in the world with more than 310,000 high school students participating annually while enrolled in over 1,700 secondary educational programs and encompasses a myriad of teaching goals focused on leadership, teamwork, character education, personal responsibility, a sense of accomplishment, and service to the nation. Two of the most important assets for JROTC are the Cadets/students and the nearly 4,000 instructors who lead, guide, and mentor their Cadets. Because of the significance of the mission, United States Army Cadet Command (USACC) has established an enhanced means of communicating both within the command and externally through the U.S. Army JROTC Web Portal. The Web Portal provides the media for JROTC Cadets and instructors to connect to the world and for the world’s public audience to communicate with the Army JROTC program.",

There are three typical functions of a GSA club: Support, Social, and Activist. While GSA clubs have traditionally served as safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth to build awareness and community as well as prevent discrimination and harassment in schools, they are now emerging as vehicles for deeper social change that extends beyond individual schools.

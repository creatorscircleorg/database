Students take the lead as their team races against the clock to develop a world-changing idea and pitch it to potential investors at the end-of-week competition. Guided by a mentor from a local business, students learn to work as a team, explore careers, take a test run of university life, build a network with professionals and future leaders, earn college credit, and maybe even win a scholarship. Each day students and their companies dive into real-world business simulation in the career pathway they’ve chosen. Students make “real life” decisions as a team and participate in interactive projects with other teen companies. Business leaders from around the state share their experiences and challenges, and provide valuable insight and direction as they mentor the teams.",

Although the main focus of the series is attending lectures similar to what students will be exposed to in college, students will also have opportunities to experience several hands-on demonstrations and simulation labs at Stanford. Furthermore, there will be opportunities to participate in lunch discussions with college, graduate school and medical school students to learn about the application process as well as to learn about what their experiences have been like. Students will be provided with a notebook, pen, bag and a course reader for optional background reading. No homework assignments will be given. The schedule is 9am-12pm daily (except on Mondays—the session will end at 12:30pm including lunch that is provided).

It is one of the largest youth programs in the world with more than 310,000 high school students participating annually while enrolled in over 1,700 secondary educational programs and encompasses a myriad of teaching goals focused on leadership, teamwork, character education, personal responsibility, a sense of accomplishment, and service to the nation. Two of the most important assets for JROTC are the Cadets/students and the nearly 4,000 instructors who lead, guide, and mentor their Cadets. Because of the significance of the mission, United States Army Cadet Command (USACC) has established an enhanced means of communicating both within the command and externally through the U.S. Army JROTC Web Portal. The Web Portal provides the media for JROTC Cadets and instructors to connect to the world and for the world’s public audience to communicate with the Army JROTC program.",

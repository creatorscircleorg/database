We firmly believe that everyone, regardless of background, can thrive as a computer scientist. We start off each summer assuming absolutely no prior programming experience, and by the time we're done our students are routinely creating their own games and custom animations as final projects. Our students have gone on to study computer science in college (around 40% of students go on to take a CS class in their first year of college, and around 20% end up declaring computer science as a major).

There are three typical functions of a GSA club: Support, Social, and Activist. While GSA clubs have traditionally served as safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth to build awareness and community as well as prevent discrimination and harassment in schools, they are now emerging as vehicles for deeper social change that extends beyond individual schools.

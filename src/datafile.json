There are three typical functions of a GSA club: Support, Social, and Activist. While GSA clubs have traditionally served as safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth to build awareness and community as well as prevent discrimination and harassment in schools, they are now emerging as vehicles for deeper social change that extends beyond individual schools. Trans and queer youth are building their power through GSA organizing and connecting to state and national campaigns on a variety of issues that affect all students across the country.",

The 2018 program will cater to the literary genres of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. The aim of the mentorship program is not formalized instruction, but rather an individualized, flexible, and often informal correspondence. Poetry mentorship students will share weekly work with mentors and peers, while prose mentorship students will share biweekly work with mentors and peers.",

A subset of the students may have already taken economics classes, and for those students, the goal is to cultivate their interest in economics and introduce them to economics as an observational science with new topics, problems, and experiments. This workshop does not assume any previous study in economics. Please note, the 2018 workshop will be an all commuter program. Students that are able to commute to and from the workshop are welcome to apply. Students are responsible for their transportation commuting to and from the workshop each day.",

Guided by a mentor from a local business, students learn to work as a team, explore careers, take a test run of university life, build a network with professionals and future leaders, earn college credit, and maybe even win a scholarship. Each day students and their companies dive into real-world business simulation in the career pathway they’ve chosen. Students make “real life” decisions as a team and participate in interactive projects with other teen companies. Business leaders from around the state share their experiences and challenges, and provide valuable insight and direction as they mentor the teams.",
